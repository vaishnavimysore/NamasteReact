<!-- 
A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that 
caches content close to end users. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content,
including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.
    
The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.

Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.

A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.

CORS is used to manage cross-origin requests.

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside their own domain.
