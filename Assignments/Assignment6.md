1. What is a Microservice?
   
A: Microservices are light weight, self contained components that perform respective tasks. It is an architectural approach that involves dividing large applications into smaller, functional units capable of functioning and communicating independently depending upon their use case. Developers can now achieve the scalability, simplicity, and flexibility needed to create highly sophisticated software applications. 

-Each service can be written in different languages and still communicate with each other unlike monolith architecture.
-Separation of concerns is followed/achieved.
-Single responsibility principle is followed. This principle states that each service follows and does only a single job/task.
-With microservices architecture, all teams work independently on their own respective service, they have their own build and deploy cycle unlike the monolith architecture.

For ex, our UI is deployed on a port(:1234), the same way all other services are deployed on different ports of their own. At the end for any request or a service , all the ports are mapped to a single domain name

2. What is Monolith Architecture?
   
A: Monolithic Architecture is like a big container, wherein all the software components of an app are assembled and tightly coupled, i.e., each component fully depends on each other. All the code, build and deployment is single and dependent. One failure will cause a failure in the whole application. To make a change to this sort of application requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface. This makes updates restrictive and time-consuming. means we are not dividing software into small, well-defined modules, we use every services like, database, server or a UI of the application, in one Application file.

4. What is the difference between Monolith and Microservices architecture?
   
A: 
Monolith : A monolithic architecture is a traditional software development model that uses one code base to perform multiple business functions. All the software components in a monolithic system are interdependent due to the data exchange mechanisms within the system. Itâ€™s restrictive and time-consuming to modify monolithic architecture as small changes impact large areas of the code base.

Microservices : In contrast, microservices are an architectural approach that composes software into small independent components or services. Each service performs a single function and communicates with other services through a well-defined interface. Because they run independently, you can update, modify, deploy, or scale each service as required.

5. Why do we need useEffect Hook?
   
A: Side effects are not predictable because they are actions which are performed with the "outside world." We perform a side effect when we need to reach outside of our React components to do something. Performing a side effect, however, will not give us a predictable result.

Common side effects include:
-Making a request to an API for data from a backend server
-To interact with browser APIs (that is, to use document or window directly)
-Using unpredictable timing functions like setTimeout or setInterval

This is why useEffect exists: to provide a way to handle performing these side effects in what are otherwise pure React components.
Side effects should be separated from the rendering process. If we need to perform a side effect, it should strictly be done after our component renders.
This is what useEffect gives us. In short, useEffect is a tool that lets us interact with the outside world but not affect the rendering or performance of the component that it's in.

```
// 1. import useEffect
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  // 2. call it above the returned JSX  
  // 3. pass two arguments to it: a function and an array
  useEffect(() => {}, []);    
  
  // return ...
}

 The [] is an empty dependency array. If no dependency array is given, then the page keeps on rendering causing an infinite loop.
  If an empty dependency array is given, then page is rendered only once during the start
  If dependency array is given a value, then the page is rendered whenever the value in the array changes/updates.

```

6. What is optional chaining?

A: 
The ``` ?. ``` operator is like the ``` . ``` chaining operator, except that instead of causing an error if a reference is nullish (null or undefined), the expression short-circuits with a return value of undefined. When used with function calls, it returns undefined if the given function does not exist. This results in shorter and simpler expressions when accessing chained properties when the possibility exists that a reference may be missing. It can also be helpful while exploring the content of an object when there's no known guarantee as to which properties are required.

```
let user = {}; // a user without "address" property

alert(user.address.street); // Error!

alert(user.address ? user.address.street : undefined); - OPTIONAL CHAINING!!
```

7. What is Shimmer UI?

A: A shimmer UI is a version of the UI that doesn't contain actual content, but instead mimics the layout and shapes of the content that will eventually appear. It uses a gradient animation that creates a shimmering effect over the placeholders, giving the user a sense of motion and progress.

A shimmer UI has many benefits over traditional loading indicators:

It improves the perceived performance of the app by making it seem faster and more responsive.
It reduces the cognitive load on the user by providing visual cues about the type and structure of the content that is being loaded.
It eliminates surprises and confusion by showing a consistent and predictable UI before and after loading.
It enhances the aesthetic appeal and user satisfaction by creating a smooth and elegant transition from loading to loaded.
